            <p>EEBO-TCP is a partnership between the Universities of Michigan and Oxford and the publisher ProQuest to create accurately transcribed and encoded texts based on the image sets published by ProQuest via their Early English Books Online (EEBO) database (http://eebo.chadwyck.com). The general aim of EEBO-TCP is to encode one copy (usually the first edition) of every monographic English-language title published between 1473 and 1700 available in EEBO.</p>
            <p>EEBO-TCP aimed to produce large quantities of textual data within the usual project restraints of time and funding, and therefore chose to create diplomatic transcriptions (as opposed to critical editions) with light-touch, mainly structural encoding based on the Text Encoding Initiative (http://www.tei-c.org).</p>
            <p>The EEBO-TCP project was divided into two phases. The 25,368 texts created during Phase 1 of the project (2000-2009), initially available only to institutions that contributed to their creation, were released into the public domain on 1 January 2015. The approximately 40,000 texts produced during Phase 2 (2009- ), of which 34,963 had been released as of 2020, originally similarly restricted, were similarly freed from all restrictions on 1 August 2020. As of that date anyone is free to take and use these texts for any purpose (modify them, annotate them, distribute them, etc.). But we do respectfully request that due credit and attribution be given to their original source.</p>
            <p>Users should be aware of the process of creating the TCP texts, and therefore of any assumptions that can be made about the data.</p>
            <p>Text selection was based on the New Cambridge Bibliography of English Literature (NCBEL). If an author (or for an anonymous work, the title) appears in NCBEL, then their works are eligible for inclusion. Selection was intended to range over a wide variety of subject areas, to reflect the true nature of the print record of the period. In general, first editions of a works in English were prioritized, although there are a number of works in other languages, notably Latin and Welsh, included and sometimes a second or later edition of a work was chosen if there was a compelling reason to do so.</p>
            <p>Image sets were sent to external keying companies for transcription and basic encoding. Quality assurance was then carried out by editorial teams in Oxford and Michigan. 5% (or 5 pages, whichever is the greater) of each text was proofread for accuracy and those which did not meet QA standards were returned to the keyers to be redone. After proofreading, the encoding was enhanced and/or corrected and characters marked as illegible were corrected where possible up to a limit of 100 instances per text. Any remaining illegibles were encoded as &lt;gap&gt;s. Understanding these processes should make clear that, while the overall quality of TCP data is very good, some errors will remain and some readable characters will be marked as illegible. Users should bear in mind that in all likelihood such instances will never have been looked at by a TCP editor.</p>
            <p>The texts were encoded and linked to page images in accordance with level 4 of the TEI in Libraries guidelines.</p>
            <p>Copies of the texts have been issued variously as SGML (TCP schema; ASCII text with mnemonic sdata character entities); displayable XML (TCP schema; characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or text strings within braces); or lossless XML (TEI P5, characters represented either as UTF-8 Unicode or TEI g elements).</p>
            <p>Keying and markup guidelines are available at the <ref target="http://www.textcreationpartnership.org/docs/.">Text Creation Partnership web site</ref>.</p>

            <p>YOu know how that after <hi>Gideon</hi> had ſlain the Kings of Midian, <hi>Then the men of Iſrael ſaid unto him, Rule thou over us, both thou, and thy ſon, and thy ſon's ſon alſo, for thou haſt delivered us from the hand of Midian: And Gideon ſaid unto them, I will not rule over you,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Judg. 8.22.</note> 
               <hi>nei<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ther ſhall my ſon rule over you: Jehovah ſhall rule over you. And the Country was in quietneſs forty years in the dayes of Gideon.</hi>
               <note place="margin">verſ. 28. verſ. 33, 34, 35.</note> But afterwards when <hi>they forgat Jehovah their God,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 9.6.</note> they made <hi>Abimelech</hi> (the concubines ſon in <hi>Shechem</hi>) <hi>King,</hi>
               <note place="margin">verſ. 57. verſ. 14, 15, 16, 21. verſ. 7.3.</note> upon whom God brought <hi>the Curſe of (Jotham) Gi<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deons youngeſt ſon,</hi> who called <hi>Abimelech the Bramble,</hi> and his ambition after the Kingſhip the Brambles choice, and others leavings.</p>
            <p>Therefore O ye choſen and betruſted Princes of <hi>England,</hi> what is in your mindes, that ye now are about to ſet up a King over us again, ſince we have been and ſtill are ſet free by your pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>deceſſors, the former Parliament, who after long and large expe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>rience aboliſhed the Kingſhip, which you are about to eſtabliſh? And <hi>Oliver</hi> Lord Protector, then Lieut. General, conſented heartily thereunto, as in (charity) we verilie believed.</p>
            <p>And it's remarkable, that in the time of the late warrs the LORD of Hoſts never wrought more powerfully for <hi>Eng<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>land</hi> then when the Parliaments Commiſſions were moſt effe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ctual againſt the King, and his Malignant partie: Then were the enemies of God broken in pieces, diſſipated and diſſimated, and their King cut off,<hi>as the foam upon the water:</hi> And the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office being utterly aboliſhed with the houſe of Lords as uſe<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>leſs and burthenſome, God went on with his mercies, crowning this Commonwealth with many Victories.</p>
            <p>Since which time (before the late diſaſter at <hi>Hiſpaniola</hi>) <hi>Peoples have been ſubdued by us, and nations under our feet.</hi> As if the moſt high God had taken upon him to be King of the good people of <hi>England</hi> as formerly of <hi>Iſrael</hi> (in the dayes of the <hi>Judges</hi> till <hi>Samuel</hi> the <hi>Prophet</hi>) who under ſpecious pre<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>tences ſaid,<note place="margin">1 Sam. 8.</note> 
               <hi>Make us a King,</hi> 1 <hi>Sam.</hi> 8.5. <hi>there ſhall be a

               <note place="margin">verſ. 19, 20.</note> 
               <hi>that we alſo may be like all the Nations, and that our King may judge us, and go out before us, and fight our battels.</hi> For the <hi>Philiſtins</hi> and the <hi>Ammonites</hi> were e<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>nemies to them, as the <hi>Spaniards</hi> and the <hi>French</hi> to us; and what reaſon have we to ask a <hi>King</hi> more then they? But the thing diſpleaſed the LORD and <hi>Samuel;</hi> and it was accounted no bet<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ter then a rejecting of <hi>God:</hi> and <hi>Samuel</hi> declared the ſore op<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>preſſion which the King would exerciſe over them by his own will, and that the Lord would not hear them when they cried un<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>to him by reaſon thereof.<note place="margin">verſ. 11, 18,</note>
            </p>
            <p>Nevertheleſs they waved the religious counſel of the Prophet <hi>Samuel,</hi>
               <note place="margin">verſ. 19.</note> and proceeded in their politick reſolutions, and <hi>the Lord gave them a King in his anger,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 13.11.</note> and by thunder and haile from heaven convinced them of this their wickedneſs:<note place="margin">Judg. 12. verſ. 19.</note> and they con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>feſſed, ſaying,<note place="margin">Chap. 9.13.</note> 
               <hi>We have added unto all our ſins this evil, to ask us a King,</hi> although they had not ought to ſay againſt their King, for <hi>King Saul</hi> was a member of the Church, and a man well fitted and qualified both in body and minde, for the King<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ly Office, and ſought not the place, but in humility ſaid, <hi>Am not I a Benjamite,</hi>
               <note place="margin">verſ. 21.</note> 
               <hi>of the ſmalleſt of the tribes of Iſrael, and my family the leaſt of all?</hi> and he was ſo wiſe, and prudent, and ſo far from vain-glory, that <hi>he told not his uncle of the matter of the Kingdom,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Chap. 10.16.</note> 
               <hi>whereof Samuel ſpake unto him;</hi> and in modeſtie, being little in his own eyes, not counting himſelf wor<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>thy or fit for, the Kingdom, which fell unto him by the Lords Lot, he <hi>hid himſelf among the ſtuffe,</hi>
               <note place="margin">verſ. 22, 23.34.</note> till by the direction of God, the people <hi>fetched him</hi> thence, and proclaimed him King. Since which time, when the Iſraelites revolted more and more from God, he hath complained againſt them, ſaying, <hi>They have ſet up Kings,</hi>
               <note place="margin">Hoſ. 8.4.</note> 
               <hi>but not by me; they have made Princes, and I knew it not.</hi>

            <p>And what ſafety or ſecurity can we expect by the <hi>King</hi> whom you ſhall chuſe, <hi>whoſe life is but a vapour?</hi> and are you ſure his <hi>Children</hi> will be right and juſt? <hi>Who knoweth whether he that ſhall come and reign after him,</hi>

               <hi>ſhall be a wiſe man, or a fool? Then wo to this land, when thy King is a Child.</hi>
            </p>
            <p>Conſider the great danger miſchief, and inconvenience which may happen upon this evil choice of a <hi>King:</hi> For it is not to be doubted but that the hearts of all the well-affected, and well-informed <hi>Miniſters and People</hi> will be againſt it, as they have been at the beginning; And it may well be feared that ſuch a <hi>Regal choiſe</hi> will involve the Commonwealth in <hi>a Chaos of con<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>fuſion,</hi> and the ſame may prove of dangerous conſequence, and beget a <hi>Triangle diviſion,</hi> a ſecond moſt cruel bloody and unnatural war, and lay the Land open to a forreign enemie, and ſo the laſt errour will be worſe then the firſt.</p>
            <p>Pitie it is that all the blood which hath been ſpilt and trea<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>ſure ſpent to purchaſe our freedom, ſhould be made ineffectual, to the gratifying of our enemies, and grieving our friends, trifling out the precious time, to twiſt briars and brambles, in ſtead of ta<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>king off <hi>the yoke of oppreſſion and letting the oppreſſed go free,</hi> Iſa. 58.</p>
            <p>Much more might be ſaid againſt the aforeſaid Regal choice; but you know the Scripture, Law, Reaſon, good mens writings, Parliamentary Sermons, the nations Ingagement and Articles of Government, to be all againſt it; and ſo is an honeſt and unper<g ref="char:EOLhyphen"/>jured Engliſh heart.</p>
